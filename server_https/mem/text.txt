Put text here to make it into a larger file, at least having 1024*100 bytes, so that they need to split it into 100 chunks
Try to make each of these chunks distinct, so that while checking, we can open files and easily tell if they are split properly

example put a starting and ending code which we need to see in every file if its been split properly.
